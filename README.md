# RestAPI-SpringBoot-BoilerPlate
Spring Boot Project that creates REST APIs that post/get data from a local MongoDB database.

To get the project working, it requires a local installation of MongoDB, this is much easier on OSX or Unix, but on Windows it is possible, it just requires additional steps, please navigate to this link to find how to properly install and set up MongoDB: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

Simply clone the repository into your local directory.
Then start up the IDE of your choice, any that supports Maven (JBoss, Spring Tool Suite, NetBeans, etc).
Choose open existing projects from file system, then navigate to the cloned project.
The IDE should then create the necessary settings for the project and allow you to create work with the files.
To run, right-click and run com.springboot.main/Applicaton.java
